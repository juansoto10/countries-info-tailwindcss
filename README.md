# Countries Info Website

This website allows users to see basic information about all the countries around the world. The user can filter by region or search directly by name.

The project was developed using JavaScript to create the cards for each country dynamically  by manipulating DOM content, obtaining the information either by making requests to an API REST or using a JS Object that contains the data.

The layout is made using HTML5 and TailwindCSS to style the site and making a responsive design.
